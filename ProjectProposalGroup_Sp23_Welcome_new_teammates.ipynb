        "The meteoric rise of TikTok has been a shock to many individuals and companies alike. TikTok’s ever increasing popularity has found itself becoming ubiquitous on the average American citizen’s smartphone. But its popularity brought itself onto the forefront of many debates from security and privacy issues to whether or not it contributes to the decrease of attention span of the modern populace. It has risen to the top three of many people’s list of most frequently used social media apps [1], which has caught the attention of many platforms wanting to ride on TikTok’s success by copying its formula, one of which is YouTube. YouTube released their YouTube Shorts in a response to TikTok’s success.\n",
        "\n",
        "Previous outside studies have found that TikTok does indeed have negative effects towards attention span [2]. This is done through the infinite scroll feature and powerful algorithm accompanying it to feed users content streamlined to them. The article also points out that some people “reported that they used to watch a 10-30 minute video in the past but have now found themselves losing interest in a matter of a few minutes.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Our group wanted to explore the effect TikTok has had on the attention spans of individuals who used the app and compare it to how users interact with YouTube now. Specifically, we want to see how YouTube’s video formats have changed and how long users spent time watching videos from before TikTok’s popularity to now.\n",
